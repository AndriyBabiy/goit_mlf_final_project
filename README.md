# Machine Learning Foundations - Final Project #
Overview of the Project

Dataset - Set of anonymised data from a telecommunications company. Project lies in creating a prediction model that can work with a large amount of input features.

Goal - Find the customers that are likely to switch their service provider (Predicting Customer Churn)

This code was build out using the Spyder IDE and as such a lot of the information is saved in variables that were accessible in the variable exporer section of the interface. I have added print versions of the results in order to have the logical process be more evident in the notebook format.

There is also a lot of code commented out as during the process of the project I encountered difficulties in effectively applying the sklearn.Pipeline approach to building out the model processing and have left in the comments for anyone interested
