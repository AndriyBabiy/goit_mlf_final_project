# Machine Learning Foundations - Final Project #
**Overview of the Project**

**Dataset** - Set of anonymised data from a telecommunications company. Project lies in creating a prediction model that can work with a large amount of input features.

**Goal** - Find the customers that are likely to switch their service provider (Predicting Customer Churn)

_This code was build out using the Spyder IDE and as such a lot of the information is saved in variables that were accessible in the variable exporer section of the interface. I have added print versions of the results in order to have the logical process be more evident in the notebook format._

_There is also a lot of code commented out as during the process of the project I encountered difficulties in effectively applying the sklearn.Pipeline approach to building out the model processing and have left in the comments for anyone interested_

Feel free to have a look at the notebook in the directory of this repository or for a better reading experience have a look at the notebook on colab -> [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AndriyBabiy/goit_mlf_final_project/blob/main/MLF_Final_Project_Andriy_B.ipynb)
